        <h1>Tribute to Earth Planetarians</h1>
        <p>O mighty Earth, where life takes root,</p>
        <p>In hues of green and skies so blue.</p>
        <p>From mountain peaks to oceans deep,</p>
        <p>Your beauty wakes from ancient sleep.</p>
            <br>
        <p>Cradle forests, vast and wide,</p>
        <p>Where whispering winds and rivers glide.</p>
        <p>Your valleys bloom with flowers bright,</p>
        <p>A canvas painted by morning light.</p>
            <br>
        <p>Deserts glow with golden sands,</p>
        <p>The seas caress your gentle lands.</p>
        <p>From frozen poles to tropic shores,</p>
        <p>You are the breath that life adores.</p>
            <br>
        <p>Your skies, all creatures play,</p>
        <p>You gift them night, you gift them day.</p>
        <p>Your pulse is felt in every tree,</p>
        <p>A heartbeat shared by all that be.</p>
            <br>
        <p>We, your children, often blind,</p>
        <p>Forget your grace, your gift so kind.</p>
        <p>We carve and take, we build and burn,</p>
        <p>Yet still, for us, your rivers turn.</p>
            <br>
        <p>Precious Earth, so strong, so frail,</p>
        <p>We owe you more than words can tell.</p>
        <p>May we protect, may we defend,</p>
        <p>Our only home, our dearest friend.</p>
